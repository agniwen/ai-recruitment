Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues for `agniwen/ai-recruitment`; external PRs are not a triage request surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The triage label vocabulary uses the default five labels: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, and `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Domain documentation uses the single-context layout: root `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Project Overview

AI-powered voice interview/resume screening application. Chinese-first locale — agent instructions and interview prompts are in Simplified Chinese.

## Architecture

- **Web app** (`apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/`): TanStack Start + React 19, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, Vite/Nitro, shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4. It mounts the Hono backend at `/api` for integrated web runs.
- **Backend app** (`apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/`): Hono API runtime, Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL, Better Auth. It can be mounted by the web app at `/api` or started as a standalone Node app.
- **Voice agent** (`apps/livekit-agent/`): Python LiveKit Agents SDK with OpenAI / Google / ElevenLabs / Minimax plugins, Silero VAD, turn-detector
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspace + Turborepo at the root; shared packages in `packages/` (`@arc/shared` — shared types, schemas, and isomorphic utilities; `@arc/db-schema` — Drizzle schema/relations + DB-adjacent shared types; `@arc/adapter-feishu` — Feishu chat adapter). Workspace packages are scoped under `@arc/*`.

Two separate package managers: **pnpm** for web, **uv** for Python agent. Do not mix them.

## Commands

### Root (Turborepo)

- `pnpm dev` — turbo run dev across apps
- `pnpm build` / `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm test` — fan-out via turbo
- `pnpm check` / `pnpm fix` — Ultracite lint/format across the whole repo
- `pnpm hooks` — install lefthook git hooks (run once after clone)
- `pnpm db:generate` / `pnpm db:migrate` / `pnpm db:studio` — proxy to the web app's drizzle scripts

### Web (`apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/`)

Either run via turbo from the root, or directly:

- `pnpm --filter @arc/ai-recruitment-copilot dev` — TanStack Start dev server
- `pnpm --filter @arc/ai-recruitment-copilot build` — production build
- `pnpm --filter @arc/ai-recruitment-copilot typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @arc/ai-recruitment-copilot test` / `test:watch` — Vitest
- `pnpm --filter @arc/ai-recruitment-copilot db:generate` / `db:migrate` / `db:studio`

### Backend (`apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/`)

- `pnpm --filter @arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend start` — start the standalone Hono Node server; defaults to `HOST=0.0.0.0` and `PORT=8787`
- `pnpm --filter @arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend dev:standalone` — standalone Hono server in watch mode
- `pnpm --filter @arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend test` / `test:watch` — Vitest

### Agent (from `apps/livekit-agent/`)

- `uv sync` — install dependencies
- `uv run src/agent.py download-files` — download VAD + turn-detector models (required before first run)
- `uv run src/agent.py dev` — dev mode with hot reload
- `uv run src/agent.py console` — interactive terminal chat
- `uv run pytest` — run tests
- `uv run ruff format` — format Python code
- `uv run ruff check` — lint Python code

### Unified (Makefile)

- `make install` — full setup: web deps + agent + model downloads
- `make dev` — run web + agent in parallel
- `make agent-console` — terminal chat without web

## Frontend Route Layout (`apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/src/routes/`)

Keep `src/routes/` limited to TanStack Router route modules: route declarations, route-level loaders, search validation, and thin page composition. Do not place reusable components, page sections, hooks, state models, dialog groups, list renderers, or other helper modules in `src/routes/`, including files hidden from route generation with a `-` prefix. Put feature-owned UI and client state under `src/components/features/<feature>/`; put reusable client utilities under `src/lib/client/` and TanStack Start server helpers under `src/lib/start/`.

Route modules should import feature components and remain the routing boundary rather than growing into page implementations or state containers.

## Server Route Layout (`apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/src/server/routes/`)

Every route folder is a self-contained unit:

- **Required**: `route.ts` exporting a Hono router. Middleware must be declared **inside** the router via `.use(...)` at the closest common-ancestor route (the GCD of paths it applies to). Do **not** add per-feature `.use(...)` calls in `app.ts` — `app.ts` is mount-only.
- **Optional**: `schema.ts` (Zod schemas), `dao.ts` or `dao/` (database queries), `utils.ts` or `utils/` (feature-internal helpers, services, AI processing).
- **Nested children**: when a route needs to split into multiple sub-routers (e.g. `/studio` → `interviews`, `departments`, …), put each child under a `routes/` subfolder (`routes/studio/routes/interviews/`). The same convention applies recursively.
- **Path-based split rule**: split by URL path depth when the child path represents a real sub-resource or sub-module. Keep collection/item CRUD such as `/interviews` and `/interviews/:id` in `interviews/route.ts`; move child resources such as `/interviews/:id/reports` or `/interviews/:id/recordings/:conversationId` to `interviews/routes/reports/route.ts` or `interviews/routes/recordings/route.ts`, then mount them from the parent with `.route("/:id/reports", reportsRouter)`. Do not create dynamic-segment folders like `routes/:id/route.ts` for Hono routes.

Do **not** create top-level `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/src/server/queries/` or `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/src/server/services/` directories — co-locate DAOs/services with the route that owns them. Cross-route consumption is fine; just import from the owning route's `dao`/`utils`.

Exceptions: `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/src/server/agents/` (shared by frontend + multiple routes) and `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/src/server/middlewares/` (shared middleware library) intentionally remain at server root.

## Backend / Web Runtime Boundary

The Hono backend must stay loadable outside the TanStack Start web runtime. Files under `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/src/server/` and `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/src/lib/server/` must not import web-app-local `@/` modules, browser-only modules, or TanStack Start route/server-function helpers.

The single backend app factory is `createServerApp()` in `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/src/server/app.ts`. The TanStack Start web app mounts that factory from `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/src/server.ts`; the standalone Node entrypoint is `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/src/index.ts`. Do not fork route behavior between those two adapters.

When a backend route needs a web-runtime-only capability, introduce a small port in backend code and inject the implementation from the adapter layer. Current examples:

- Better Auth request-scoped headers go through `auth-request-context`; backend route modules should not read TanStack Start request primitives directly.
- Route/page SSR data belongs in TanStack Start route loaders or `createServerFn` handlers under `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/src/`, not in backend DAOs.

Backend runtime helpers live under `@arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/lib/server/*`. TanStack Start server-function helpers live under `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/src/lib/start/*`; they may use `@tanstack/react-start/server` request primitives and should import backend primitives from `@arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/*` rather than duplicating backend logic.

## Frontend HTTP Calls

- **JSON endpoints** → call the typed Hono RPC client at `@/lib/client/rpc` and pipe the result through `rpcFetch` from `@/lib/client/api`:

  ```ts
  import { rpcFetch } from "@/lib/client/api";
  import { rpc } from "@/lib/client/rpc";

  // happy path: returns typed body, throws ApiError on non-2xx
  return rpcFetch<StudioInterview>(
    rpc.api.studio.interviews[":id"].$get({ param: { id } }),
    "加载面试详情失败",
  );

  // idempotent reads/deletes: 404 resolves to null instead of throwing
  return rpcFetch<StudioInterview>(call, fallback, { allow404: true });
  ```

  `rpcFetch` is a thin wrapper around Hono's official `parseResponse` / `DetailedError` (from `hono/client`); on non-OK it re-throws the project's `ApiError` with `status` + `payload` + a Chinese fallback message so existing UI catch-blocks keep working.

- Server handlers must declare explicit status codes (`c.json(data, 200)`) and use `zValidator("json"|"query", schema, jsonValidatorError("..."))` for typed inputs — without those, hc loses type inference.
- **File uploads** (multipart/FormData), **streaming** (NDJSON / SSE / `new Response(stream)`), and **binary** responses (PDF, recordings) cannot use RPC — keep them on plain `fetch` or `apiFetch` from `@/lib/client/api`.
- **TanStack Start server functions / route loaders** that need absolute URLs at SSR time stay on plain `fetch` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` or `BETTER_AUTH_URL`. The rpc singleton is browser-relative.
- Date fields cross the wire as ISO strings; DAOs should `.toISOString()` Date columns before returning so the response DTO is `string` and the inferred client type matches reality.

## External Documentation

When changes touch Hono or TanStack Start/Router/Query APIs, consult the canonical documentation instead of relying on training-data recall — these projects move quickly:

- **Hono**: <https://hono.dev/llms.txt> (index) / <https://hono.dev/llms-full.txt> (full reference). The RPC guide at <https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc> covers `hc`, `parseResponse`, `DetailedError`, `InferResponseType`, `testClient`, etc.
- **TanStack Start**: <https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/overview>
- **TanStack Router**: <https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/overview>
- **TanStack Query**: <https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview>

Use the official Hono `parseResponse` / `DetailedError` rather than rolling new helpers — `rpcFetch` already wraps them; extend `rpcFetch` if you need new semantics rather than reimplementing.

## Lib Layout (`src/lib/` and `packages/shared/`)

`apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/src/lib/` is split by runtime so it's obvious from the import path which side a module is meant to run on.

- **`@arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/lib/server/*`** — Backend runtime utilities. DB client (`db/index.ts`), Better Auth (`auth.ts`), S3, PDF rasterization, Qwen OCR, resume parsing pipeline, server-side hash helpers, anything reading server secrets. These files must avoid app-local `@/` and TanStack Start request primitives so the Hono app can run in a standalone Node process.
- **`@/lib/start/*`** — TanStack Start server-function and route-loader helpers. These may use `createServerFn`, `@tanstack/react-start/server`, and backend primitives.
- **`@/lib/server/*`** — Small web server helpers that belong to the TanStack Start app but are not shared with the standalone Hono runtime.
- **`@/lib/client/*`** — Browser helpers. `rpc.ts`, `auth-client.ts`, `query-client.ts`, `clipboard.ts`, `ndjson-stream.ts`, and the `api/` wrapper layer.
- **`@arc/shared/*`** — Workspace package for pure types, Zod schemas, and isomorphic utilities (no web runtime, no server secrets, no Node-only APIs unless the API is also available in supported browsers/Node runtimes). Examples: `@arc/shared/interview/agent-instructions`, `@arc/shared/utils`, `@arc/shared/data-url`, `@arc/shared/file-hash`, `@arc/shared/departments`, `@arc/shared/studio-resumes`. Do not recreate `src/lib/shared/` inside the app.

**Drizzle schema lives in the `@arc/db-schema` workspace package**, not under `src/lib/`. The package exports `schema`, `relations`, and DB-adjacent shared types (`candidate-forms`, `db-enums`, `interview-question-templates`, `interview-session`, `interview/types`, `job-description-config`, `minimax-voices`, `studio-interviews`, `resume-parser-schema`) — anything imported by `schema.ts`. Import as `@arc/db-schema/schema`, `@arc/db-schema/relations`, `@arc/db-schema/candidate-forms`, etc. The actual DB connection lives in `@arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/lib/server/db` and imports `relations` from the package. `drizzle.config.ts` points at `../../packages/db-schema/src/schema.ts`.

When a module _mostly_ fits `@arc/shared` but has one backend-only function (e.g. `hashTemplateSnapshot` using `node:crypto`), extract that function into a sibling `*-hash.ts` (or similar) under `@arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/lib/server/` and keep the rest in `@arc/shared`. Don't pull `node:*`, TanStack Start request helpers, or app-local `@/` imports into `packages/shared/src`.

## Voice Agent Development (`apps/livekit-agent/`)

### Entrypoint and structure

- All Python agent code lives in `apps/livekit-agent/src/`. **Keep `apps/livekit-agent/src/agent.py` as the entrypoint** — the `Dockerfile` references it directly for production deployment, so do not rename or move it.
- Use `uv` for everything (install, run, test) — never mix in `pip`/`poetry`. See the Commands section above for the canonical `uv run` invocations.
- Format and lint Python with `uv run ruff format` and `uv run ruff check` before committing.

### LiveKit documentation access

LiveKit Agents evolves quickly; prefer the latest docs over training-data recall. Two access paths:

- **LiveKit CLI** (`lk docs`, requires CLI 2.15.0+ — check `lk --version`):
  - macOS: `brew install livekit-cli` (update: `brew update && brew upgrade livekit-cli`)
  - Linux: `curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io/cli | bash`
  - Windows: `winget install LiveKit.LiveKitCLI`
  - Key subcommands: `lk docs overview`, `lk docs search`, `lk docs get-page`, `lk docs code-search`, `lk docs changelog`, `lk docs submit-feedback`. Prefer browsing (`overview`/`get-page`) over `search`, and `search` over `code-search`.
- **LiveKit Docs MCP server**: Streamable HTTP transport at <https://docs.livekit.io/mcp> for IDE integration.

If you spot doc gaps or broken examples while browsing, submit feedback via `lk docs submit-feedback` (or the MCP `submit_docs_feedback` tool).

Beyond docs, `lk` also manages other LiveKit resources (e.g. SIP trunks for telephony). Run `lk --help` to explore.

### Workflows: handoffs and tasks

Voice agents are highly latency-sensitive. Avoid monolithic prompts that try to cover every conversation phase — they bloat each LLM request and hurt reliability. Use LiveKit's **handoffs** (one agent transfers control to another) and **tasks** (tightly-scoped prompts for a single outcome) to keep per-request context small and focused. See <https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows/>.

### Testing core agent behavior (TDD)

When modifying instructions, tool descriptions, or task / workflow / handoff definitions, **write tests in `agent/tests/` first** and iterate until they pass — don't guess at LLM behavior. Run with `uv run pytest`. See <https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/testing/>.

## Code Style

- **Conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- **TypeScript**: Ultracite enforces formatting/linting via oxlint + oxfmt — run `pnpm fix` before committing
- **Python**: Ruff — double quotes, 88 char line length
- **Components**: shadcn/ui with new-york style, CSS variables for theming

## Environment Setup

Copy `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/.env.example` to `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/.env` for the TanStack Start web app, and `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/.env.example` to `apps/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/.env` for standalone backend runs. The voice agent has its own `apps/livekit-agent/.env.example` if it needs separate secrets. See those `.env.example` files for the full list. Key requirements:

- LiveKit Cloud credentials (`LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`)
- Google OAuth (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- Database (`DATABASE_URL`)

### Resend (transactional email)

The round-email feature (`/api/w/:slug/studio/interviews/round-emails/...`) calls Resend with `RESEND_FROM` as the sender. **Use a bare email address** (e.g. `RESEND_FROM=noreply@your-domain.com`) — the From-header display name is built dynamically at runtime as `{globalConfig.companyName} AI HR` (or `AI HR` when no company name is set), via `buildSenderFromAddress` in `@arc/ai-recruitment-copilot-backend/lib/server/resend`. Avoid the `"Name <addr>"` form in env files because the `<>` characters get interpreted as shell redirection in many deploy scripts (Jenkins, CI). **Before sending in any non-local environment**, verify your sender domain in the [Resend dashboard](https://resend.com/domains) — otherwise Resend rejects the send. Local dev can leave `RESEND_API_KEY` unset; the route returns a structured 500 + writes a `studio_round_email_log` row with `status='failed'` when the key is missing.

## Gotchas

- Must run `uv run src/agent.py download-files` before first agent run to download Silero VAD and turn-detector models
- Generated/upstream UI is excluded from oxlint: `src/components/agents-ui/`, `src/hooks/agents-ui/`, `src/components/ui/`, `src/components/react-bits/`, `src/components/spell-ui/` — avoid hand-editing these
- Drizzle ORM is on RC (`1.0.0-rc.1`) — pin carefully when upgrading
