# AI Recruitment Copilot

AI Recruitment Copilot is a Chinese-first recruiting workspace for resume intake, candidate review, AI voice interviews, human interviews, and recruiting collaboration. Use this glossary when naming issues, tests, refactors, and product behavior.

## Frontend Module Boundary

`apps/ai-recruitment-copilot/src/routes/` contains only TanStack Router route modules and thin route composition. Feature components, page sections, hooks, state models, dialogs, and list renderers belong under `src/components/features/<feature>/`; shared client utilities belong under `src/lib/client/`. A `-` filename prefix is not a substitute for moving feature implementation out of `src/routes/`.

**Candidate**:
A person being evaluated by a workspace for one or more job descriptions or interview rounds.
_Avoid_: Applicant when the record is already inside the workspace

**Candidate Recruiting Record**:
The workspace record that tracks one candidate in the context of one job and its recruiting pipeline. AI interview rounds belong to this record; each interview report and its versions belong to exactly one AI interview round rather than directly to the candidate record.

_Avoid_: Resume record, S3 object

**Resume Screening Rule**:
A job-description-specific requirement used to compare a resume profile against recruiting expectations before interview progression.
_Avoid_: Prompt instruction, hidden hard filter

**Draft Resume Screening Rule**:
A resume screening rule suggestion that has not yet been confirmed for use in resume screening.
_Avoid_: Active rule, saved requirement

**Active Resume Screening Rule**:
A resume screening rule that has been confirmed for use in resume screening.
_Avoid_: AI suggestion, draft rule

**Resume Screening Rule Severity**:
The configured strength of a resume screening rule, determining whether a rule result is informational, warning-level, or blocking for screening guidance.
_Avoid_: Score weight, automatic outcome

**Deterministic Resume Screening Rule**:
A resume screening rule that can be evaluated from structured resume profile fields without semantic judgment.
_Avoid_: AI judgment, semantic requirement

**Resume Screening Field Rule**:
A resume screening rule evaluated from a specific structured resume profile field, such as education level or work years.
_Avoid_: Skill semantic match, open-ended evidence rule

**Resume Screening Skill Rule**:
A resume screening rule where a recruiter configures required skills and the system evaluates resume evidence for semantically equivalent skill experience.
_Avoid_: Manually maintained alias list, open-ended semantic requirement

**Semantic Resume Screening Rule**:
A resume screening rule that asks whether the resume provides evidence for a qualitative job expectation.
_Avoid_: Deterministic failure, automatic disqualification

**Resume Screening Evidence Agent**:
The narrow AI evaluator that extracts evidence for resume screening skill rules and semantic resume screening rules.
_Avoid_: Resume review agent, final decision maker

**Resume Screening Policy**:
The current set of resume screening rules configured on a job description.
_Avoid_: Resume review prompt, candidate filter text

**Resume Screening Result**:
The system's recommendation after applying resume screening rules to a resume record; it may suggest pass, hold, or risk, but it is not a final candidate outcome.
_Avoid_: Rejection, candidate status, final verdict

**Resume Screening Evidence**:
The cited resume fact, text, inference, or manual note used to explain one resume screening rule result.
_Avoid_: Hidden model reasoning, score rationale

**Resume Screening Recommendation**:
The action guidance produced by a resume screening result, limited to pass, flag, or hold unless a human later changes the candidate outcome.
_Avoid_: Automatic rejection, closed outcome

**Resume Screening Snapshot**:
The stable record of which resume screening policy and rule results were used for one resume screening result.
_Avoid_: Current job rule, live policy

**Stale Resume Screening Snapshot**:
A resume screening snapshot created with an older resume screening policy than the current job description policy.
_Avoid_: Invalid result, failed screening

**Resume Review**:
The generated evaluation of how a resume record matches a job description, including dimensions, strengths, risks, and next-step guidance.
_Avoid_: Screening result, final candidate outcome, manual feedback note

**Resume Scoring Policy**:
A workspace-owned scoring configuration that chooses which resume-review dimensions participate, how their weights are assigned, and which job descriptions it applies to. Each workspace has exactly one global default policy (system-seeded, editable, not deletable); additional policies bind exclusively to selected job descriptions and override the global default for those jobs. Management follows workspace permission statements, while job bindings remain constrained by recruiting-group and hiring-unit visibility.
_Avoid_: Dimension config, scoring template, weight settings, six-dimension config

**Resume Scoring Policy Snapshot**:
The frozen copy of the resume scoring policy used when one resume review score was produced, so later policy edits do not silently rewrite historical scores.
_Avoid_: Live policy, current weight settings

**Dimension Deduction Rule**:
A fixed-identity scoring rule (stable rule id) that defines how one resume-review dimension loses points from a 100 baseline; the deduction amount may be configured per workspace while the rule catalog stays product-defined.
_Avoid_: Soft checklist, free-form score rationale, per-policy deduction table

**Workspace Deduction Rule Set**:
The workspace-owned table of deduction amounts (and optional per-rule enablement) applied when computing resume-review dimension raw scores.
_Avoid_: Scoring policy weights, screening rules

**Resume Review Composite Score**:
The weighted overall score of a resume review under the effective scoring policy snapshot, shown to one decimal place. Within candidates who have cleared resume screening, it is the primary rank and score-filter signal; when screening has not passed, the score may still be shown for diagnosis but must not outrank or override the screening conclusion.
_Avoid_: Recommendation score, vector similarity score, screening result, final pass decision

**Resume Evaluation Decision**:
The single user-facing outcome for a resume at the screening/review stage, assembled from resume screening results (and hard filters when applicable) with next-step constrained by those results; dimension scores never independently authorize a more lenient outcome than screening.
_Avoid_: Parallel AI conclusions, competing badges without hierarchy

**HR Resume Assessment**:
A human-written assessment of a resume record that captures the recruiter's judgment separately from the generated resume review.
_Avoid_: Resume review, screening result, interview report

**Resume Reassessment**:
The act of regenerating both resume screening and resume review for a resume record after relevant job-description context changes.
_Avoid_: Screening-only refresh

### Interview Workflow

**AI Interview Round**:
One scheduled AI interview attempt for a candidate.
_Avoid_: Candidate row, interview record

**Interview Active Time**:
The elapsed time in an AI interview round while the candidate is connected and the interview can progress. Time spent inside the hot-reconnect grace window is excluded, although the grace window itself remains bounded.
_Avoid_: Room lifetime, wall-clock duration, recording duration

**Required Interview Question**:
A question from the question-template snapshot assigned to an AI interview round. Resume-derived personalized questions are not part of the round's required question set.
_Avoid_: Personalized question, supplementary question, generated follow-up

**Evaluation Focus**:
The assessable information a required interview question is intended to collect. It defines when the question has gathered enough evidence to complete, but it is not a standard answer or a correctness rule.
_Avoid_: Question intent, scoring answer, evaluation criterion

**Follow-up Direction**:
Guidance for probing when a candidate's answer has not yet covered a question's evaluation focus. It suggests useful avenues rather than a checklist that must be exhausted.
_Avoid_: Required subquestion, completion checklist

**Skipped Interview Question**:
A required interview question that the candidate explicitly declines after one confirmation. It is recorded as a candidate skip, receives zero credit, and does not prevent the round from continuing.
_Avoid_: Unasked interview question, unanswered question

**Insufficient Interview Question**:
A required interview question the candidate attempted but whose evaluation focus remained unsupported after the permitted follow-ups. It records inadequate coverage and lets the round continue without assigning a score by itself.
_Avoid_: Skipped interview question, incorrect answer, zero-score answer

**Interrupted Interview Question**:
A required interview question that started but could not reach a coverage outcome before the round ended. It preserves partial participation and records whether time pressure, disconnect, candidate choice, or system shutdown caused the interruption.
_Avoid_: Unasked interview question, insufficient interview question

**Unasked Interview Question**:
A required question that an AI interview round ended before starting. It records why coverage was incomplete and is neither a candidate skip nor a zero-score answer.
_Avoid_: Skipped question, unanswered question, incorrect answer

**Interview Question Outcome**:
The round-scoped process record for one required interview question, including whether it was answered, skipped, or unasked and its timing and follow-up count. It supports coverage auditing but is not interview report evidence; scoring must continue to cite the original transcript.
_Avoid_: Answer evidence, question score, generated assessment

**Call Completion Status**:
The technical completion state of an AI interview call. `success` means the round reached a normal wrap-up, including a time-driven wrap-up; `partial` means a candidate-ended round or exhausted reconnect grace preserved usable partial results; `failed` means an agent, infrastructure, or system-shutdown failure prevented normal completion. It does not replace per-question outcomes.
_Avoid_: Interview score, hiring recommendation, question outcome

**Schedule Entry**:
The round-level scheduling and status record for an AI interview.
_Avoid_: Calendar event, timeslot

**Human Interview**:
A live interview session involving a human interviewer and a candidate.
_Avoid_: AI interview, manual round

**Interview Report**:
The versioned, reviewable evaluation output for one AI interview round, combining evidence from the candidate's resume, submitted forms, and that round's interview. A candidate may have multiple interview reports.
_Avoid_: Candidate-level aggregate report, summary, feedback note

**Interview Report Evidence**:
An immutable source fact cited by an interview report conclusion from exactly one of three source families: resume content, a submitted form response, or a candidate statement from that AI interview round. Generated assessments and prior report conclusions are derived material, not evidence.
_Avoid_: AI rationale, report conclusion, prompt context

**Interview Report Conclusion**:
One structured claim in an interview report that cites at least one interview report evidence item. The report's overall recommendation refers to conclusions rather than introducing unsupported claims.
_Avoid_: Evidence quote, report section, free-form rationale

**Interview Report Evidence Conflict**:
A structured disagreement between source facts that must retain references to the conflicting evidence and request human resolution instead of silently selecting one account.
_Avoid_: Missing source, low confidence, rejected report

**Interview Report Schema Version**:
The version of the interview report data contract used to parse and validate its stored content.
_Avoid_: Report version, prompt version

**Interview Report Version**:
The immutable business revision number of an interview report within one AI interview round.
_Avoid_: Schema version, edit count

**Interview Report Review**:
The attributable decision process applied in the authenticated system to one immutable submitted interview report version. Once submitted, the system does not revise or regenerate that round's report.
_Avoid_: Report editing, recruitment stage, document status

**Business Interview Entry Gate**:
The human decision made from one submitted interview report version: advance the candidate to the human interview stage or close the recruiting record as rejected.
_Avoid_: AI recommendation, human interview outcome, report status

**Interview Report Reviewer**:
A workspace member who may decide the business interview entry gate for candidate recruiting records within their recruiting visibility scope and granted permissions.
_Avoid_: AI evaluator, human interviewer, report author

**Interview Report Source Coverage**:
The explicit availability state of each interview report source family: available, missing, or not applicable. Missing required sources block review submission; a source omitted by the recruiting process does not.
_Avoid_: Evidence quality, completion percentage

**Interview Evidence Snapshot**:
A stable snapshot of the resume, job, submitted forms, questions, configuration, and transcript used to generate or explain one interview report.
_Avoid_: Context dump, prompt cache

**Round Invite Email**:
An email invitation for a specific interview round.
_Avoid_: Workspace invitation, reminder email

**Recruitment Stage**:
The candidate's business stage in the recruiting pipeline, such as screening, AI interview, human interview, offer, rejected, or hired.
_Avoid_: Status when the value represents pipeline meaning

### Semantic Matching

**Semantic Index**:
The vector-backed search index for resume duplicate detection and future job-to-resume recommendation.
_Avoid_: Vector database as the business source of truth

**Duplicate Match**:
A persisted or returned risk signal that one resume likely represents the same candidate as another source.
_Avoid_: Duplicate record, conflict

**Semantic Dedup**:
Duplicate detection based on resume meaning and experience overlap rather than only name, email, or phone.
_Avoid_: Identity dedup

**Recommendation**:
A job-to-resume or resume-to-job ranking built from semantic similarity and business filters.
_Avoid_: Duplicate match
