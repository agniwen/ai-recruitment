/**
 * FK-safe cleanup helpers for backend integration tests that share real Postgres.

 * Several resume-pool columns use ON DELETE SET NULL against organization/user:
 *   - resume_pool_item.organization_id / created_by / published_by / source_*
 *   - resume_pool_event.organization_id / actor_id
 *
 * If tests delete the parent org/user first (or only match pool rows by
 * organization_id after it was already nullified), the pool row becomes a
 * null-org orphan and still shows up in the public 人才库. Always delete pool
 * rows by every fixture ownership key *before* deleting orgs/users.
